A user persona is required to understand our target customer. As we need to identify our customers to create a product suitable to their needs, we need at least three personas.

The main purpose of creating a persona is to identify and define the most common needs for our customers. Personas should not be created based on one's imagination. Use real data to create personas. 

Design a form that can be used to interview potential customers and that will help in gathering information like: name, age, occupation, tech literacy, motivations, frustrations, goals and a photo. Personas need to be human, they need to reflect an actual human being and not some imaginary user.
