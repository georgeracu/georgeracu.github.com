### Status: `Accepted`
### Date: 01.08.2024


### Context

When developing a microservices-based architecture that needs to interact with several third-party interfaces, certain challenges would appear. These third-party systems have different performance characteristics, including varying response times, availability, and data formats. Currently, each microservice directly integrates with the necessary third-party systems, leading to several challenges in terms of maintainability, fault tolerance, testing, and separation of concerns.

### Decision

We have decided to adopt the API Gateway pattern as a centralized integration point for all third-party interfaces, rather than integrating these interfaces directly within each microservice.

### Key Benefits of the API Gateway Pattern

#### 1. Long-Term Maintainability

* **Centralized Management:** The API Gateway provides a single, centralized point for managing all interactions with third-party systems. This reduces the complexity within each microservice, as they no longer need to handle the intricacies of different third-party APIs directly. Changes to third-party integrations (e.g., API version updates or changes in authentication methods) can be managed in the API Gateway without affecting the microservices.
* **Reduced Code Duplication:** Without the API Gateway, each microservice would need to implement its own logic for interacting with third-party systems. This could lead to duplicated code across services, increasing the risk of inconsistencies and making the system harder to maintain. The API Gateway centralizes this logic, reducing redundancy and promoting reuse.

#### 2. Fault Tolerance

* **Resilience:** The API Gateway can implement fault tolerance mechanisms such as retries, circuit breakers, and timeouts, insulating microservices from issues in third-party systems. If a third-party service is down or slow, the API Gateway can handle these scenarios without exposing these failures directly to the microservices.
* **Graceful Degradation:** The API Gateway can provide fallback mechanisms or cached responses if a third-party service becomes unavailable. This allows the microservices to continue functioning, even in the event of external system failures, thereby improving overall system resilience.

#### 3. Testing

* **Simplified Testing:** By isolating third-party integrations within the API Gateway, microservices can be tested independently of external dependencies. Mocking the API Gateway is much simpler than mocking multiple third-party systems directly within each microservice, leading to more reliable and faster unit and integration tests.
* **Decoupled Environments:** The API Gateway can provide a consistent interface for testing, regardless of the actual third-party systems being live. This allows for more controlled and predictable testing environments, improving test coverage and quality.

#### 4. Separation of Concerns

* **Decoupling Business Logic from Communication Details:** Integrating third-party systems directly into microservices entangles business logic with communication details (e.g., API calls, data transformation, error handling). This coupling makes it difficult to modify or extend the business logic without impacting external communications. The API Gateway abstracts these concerns away from the microservices, allowing them to focus purely on domain logic.
* **Flexible Adapters:** The API Gateway can handle different data formats, authentication mechanisms, and performance optimizations specific to each third-party system. This flexibility simplifies the microservices by offloading complex integration logic to the gateway, promoting a clean and maintainable architecture.

### Alternatives

#### Comparison with Direct Integration in Microservices

| Aspect	| Direct Integration in Microservices	| API Gateway Pattern
|---        |---                                    |---
| Maintainability	| High complexity, with potential code duplication across services.	| Simplifies services, centralizes integration logic. 
| Fault Tolerance	| Each microservice must implement its own fault tolerance mechanisms.	| Centralized fault tolerance and resilience mechanisms.
| Testing	| Complex to test due to entangled third-party dependencies.	| Easier to test with simplified microservices and mockable gateway.
| Separation of Concerns	| Business logic entangled with third-party communication details.	| Clear separation of domain logic and integration concerns.

### Consequences

#### Positive Consequences:

* Improved maintainability, as third-party integration logic is centralized.
* Enhanced fault tolerance, ensuring that microservices are insulated from third-party system failures.
* Simplified testing, allowing for better test coverage and more reliable deployments.
* Better separation of concerns, leading to more modular and adaptable microservices.
* Extensibility, as other services can use the gateway to connect to the 3rd party.

#### Negative Consequences:

* Introduction of an additional component (the API Gateway), which needs to be managed and maintained.
* Potential single point of failure if the API Gateway is not highly available or properly monitored.
* Increased initial complexity in setting up the API Gateway with appropriate routing, fault tolerance, and transformation logic.

### Decision Outcome

By adopting the API Gateway pattern, we expect to significantly improve the maintainability, fault tolerance, and testability of our microservices-based architecture. The separation of business logic from third-party communication details will lead to a more robust, adaptable, and scalable system, capable of evolving with changing business requirements and external integrations.

We will proceed with implementing the API Gateway and continuously evaluate its impact on the system, making adjustments as necessary to optimize performance and maintainability.
