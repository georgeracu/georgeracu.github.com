Title: Consuming RabbitMQ Messages with Clojure: A Step-by-Step Tutorial with Tests

Introduction:
In this tutorial, we will learn how to consume messages from RabbitMQ using Clojure. RabbitMQ is a popular message broker that facilitates communication between distributed systems. We will cover the setup, creating a consumer, handling messages, and include tests using the latest versions of the libraries.

Prerequisites:
1. Basic understanding of Clojure programming.
2. RabbitMQ installed and running.

Step 1: Setup RabbitMQ Connection
Ensure you have RabbitMQ installed and running. Add the following dependencies to your project.clj or deps.edn file:

```clojure
; For dependency management
{:deps {org.clojure/clojure {:mvn/version "1.10.3"}
        com.novemberain/langohr {:mvn/version "7.1.0"}}}
```

Step 2: Create a Consumer
Let's create a consumer to receive messages from a specific queue. We'll use the `langohr` library for RabbitMQ communication.

```clojure
(ns my-namespace
  (:require [langohr.core :as rmq]
            [langohr.channel :as channel]))

(defn process-message [message]
  ; Implement your message processing logic here
  (println "Received message:" message))

(defn create-consumer [queue]
  (rmq/with-connection [conn {:uri "amqp://guest:guest@localhost"}]
    (rmq/with-channel ch conn
      (let [q (rmq/declare-queue ch queue)]
        (rmq/consume ch q process-message)))))
```

Step 3: Connect and Start Consuming
Now, call the `create-consumer` function with the name of the queue you want to consume messages from.

```clojure
(create-consumer "my-queue")
```

Step 4: Handling Messages
The `process-message` function will be called automatically when a message is received from the queue. Customize this function to handle the message based on your application's requirements.

Step 5: Writing Tests
For testing, we will use the `clojure.test` library. Add the following code to your test file:

```clojure
(ns my-namespace-test
  (:require [clojure.test :refer [deftest is]]
            [my-namespace :as consumer]))

(deftest test-consumer
  (let [queue "test-queue"]
    (consumer/create-consumer queue)
    (is (rmq/publish conn "" queue "Test message"))
    (Thread/sleep 100) ; Wait for the message to be consumed
    (is (consumer/message-received?))))

; Helper function to check if a message was received
(defn message-received? []
  ; Implement your logic to check if a message was received
  true)
```

Step 6: Run Tests
Execute the tests with the following command:

```bash
$ clj -M:test
```

Conclusion:
Congratulations! You have learned how to consume messages from RabbitMQ using Clojure, including writing tests for your code. By using the latest version of the `langohr` library, you can build robust and reliable systems for message handling and distribution. Experiment with different message processing logic, explore more features offered by RabbitMQ and Clojure, and create powerful distributed applications.

Happy coding and testing!
