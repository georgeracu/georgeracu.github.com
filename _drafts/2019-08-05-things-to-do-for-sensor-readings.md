A continuously evolving list of things to do. This list gets updated every day when new things show up from development of the sensor reading system. It includes software, hardware and other types of tasks. These tasks get translated into [Trello](https://www.trello.com) cards on the board for this project. This a condensed version of titles for the cards.

## Software

### Database

[] Make SQLite3 resilient where possible
[] Make schema generated automatically when db missing from a device
[] Make schema able to migrate

## Hardware
