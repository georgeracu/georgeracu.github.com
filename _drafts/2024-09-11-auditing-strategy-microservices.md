### Audit Strategy for User and System-to-System Interactions in a Distributed Microservices Domain

In a distributed microservices architecture where both physical users and other services trigger actions, a robust audit strategy is essential for compliance, traceability, and system integrity. The audit strategy must capture interactions across the domain, ensuring consistency and compliance with regulatory standards, such as GDPR or SOX, for auditing purposes.

#### Key Requirements for the Audit Strategy:

1. **Centralized Logging:** All services should log audit events centrally to avoid fragmentation.
2. **Event Integrity:** Ensure all logged audit events contain sufficient information for traceability.
3. **Retention and Compliance:** Retain the audit events for a period defined by compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR mandates for data retention and deletion).
4. **Message-Based Communication:** Use the existing message-based architecture for consistency across services.
5. **Common Payload Structure:** Ensure all microservices publish audit events in a standard format.
6. **Separation of Concerns:** The audit service should remain dedicated to its function, with no business logic.

### Steps for the Audit Strategy Implementation

#### 1. **Common Message Payload Design**

Define a common audit event payload that all services use when publishing audit logs to the queue of the audit-service. The common message payload should contain the following elements:

- **Event Metadata:**
  - **Event ID:** Unique identifier for the event.
  - **Timestamp:** When the event occurred (ISO 8601 format).
  - **Event Type:** Describes the action taken (e.g., `USER_LOGIN`, `SERVICE_CALL`, `DATA_UPDATE`, etc.).
  - **Service Name:** The name of the service generating the audit event.
  
- **Actor Information:**
  - **User ID or System ID:** ID of the user or service triggering the event.
  - **Actor Type:** Whether the actor is a `USER` or `SYSTEM` (helps to distinguish between user interactions and service-to-service calls).
  - **User/Service IP Address:** For tracking where the request originated from.

- **Action Context:**
  - **Operation Name:** The specific operation performed (e.g., `READ`, `CREATE`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`).
  - **Target Resource:** The resource being affected (e.g., `Order`, `Customer`, `Transaction`).
  - **Details:** A JSON structure or serialized data capturing details of the operation (e.g., updated fields or data).

- **Request/Response Info (Optional):**
  - **Request ID/Correlation ID:** To trace events across services.
  - **HTTP Method/Status Code (if applicable):** For capturing REST interactions.
  - **Response Time:** Time taken for the operation.

##### Example Payload (JSON)

```json
{
  "event_id": "e123456789",
  "timestamp": "2023-08-12T15:23:45Z",
  "event_type": "USER_LOGIN",
  "service_name": "auth-service",
  "actor": {
    "id": "user_456",
    "type": "USER",
    "ip": "192.168.0.1"
  },
  "action": {
    "operation_name": "LOGIN",
    "target_resource": "UserAccount",
    "details": {
      "login_method": "password",
      "success": true
    }
  },
  "request_info": {
    "correlation_id": "c1234abcd",
    "http_method": "POST",
    "status_code": 200,
    "response_time_ms": 125
  }
}
```

#### 2. Publishing Audit Events to the Audit Queue

Each microservice should publish its audit events to a common message queue or topic consumed by the dedicated audit-service. The service that generates an audit event will:

- Create an audit event payload following the defined common message structure.
- Publish the event to a message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka) associated with the audit-service.

```java
AuditEvent event = new AuditEvent(
    UUID.randomUUID().toString(), 
    ZonedDateTime.now(ZoneOffset.UTC),
    "USER_LOGIN",
    "auth-service",
    new Actor("user_456", "USER", "192.168.0.1"),
    new Action("LOGIN", "UserAccount", Map.of("login_method", "password", "success", true)),
    new RequestInfo("POST", 200, "c1234abcd", 125)
);

messageQueue.publish("audit-queue", event);
```

#### 3. Audit-Service Implementation

The audit-service will consume the events from the queue, validate them, and store them in a structured database (e.g., a relational database for querying, Elasticsearch for full-text search). 

- **Validation:** The audit-service validates each event against a schema to ensure it meets compliance and audit requirements.
- **Storage:** Store the events in a database with proper indexing on event types, actor information, timestamps, and resources. Use time-series databases if retention over long periods is a requirement.

#### 4. System-to-System Interaction Auditing

For system-to-system interactions, the following additional considerations apply:

- **Actor as a System:** When services call each other, the calling service should be captured as the actor.
- **Correlation IDs:** Ensure that each service passes a correlation ID through each request chain to trace interactions across services.

##### Example Payload for System Interaction

```json
{
  "event_id": "e987654321",
  "timestamp": "2023-08-12T15:23:45Z",
  "event_type": "SERVICE_CALL",
  "service_name": "order-service",
  "actor": {
    "id": "inventory-service",
    "type": "SYSTEM",
    "ip": "10.0.0.5"
  },
  "action": {
    "operation_name": "INVENTORY_CHECK",
    "target_resource": "Order",
    "details": {
      "order_id": "order_123",
      "stock_status": "available"
    }
  },
  "request_info": {
    "correlation_id": "c4567efgh",
    "http_method": "GET",
    "status_code": 200,
    "response_time_ms": 95
  }
}
```

#### 5. Retention and Archiving Strategy

- **Retention Period:** Set up retention policies based on regulatory compliance. For example, retain all audit events for 7 years.
- **Archival Process:** Implement an archival strategy to move older audit logs to cheaper storage solutions (e.g., cloud cold storage) after a certain period while maintaining query access for compliance checks.

#### 6. Security and Encryption

- **Data Encryption:** Encrypt sensitive audit events (e.g., user IDs, IP addresses) both in transit (using TLS) and at rest (using database encryption).
- **Access Control:** Ensure only authorized personnel and services can access the audit logs. Implement strict access controls and audit accesses to audit logs themselves.

#### 7. Monitoring and Alerting

Set up monitoring and alerting on the audit-service to ensure audit events are being processed reliably. If the audit-service fails to process messages from the queue, raise alerts to investigate possible issues (e.g., service downtime, queue congestion).

### Conclusion

By using a common message payload structure and leveraging the message queue infrastructure, this audit strategy ensures that both user interactions and system-to-system communications are captured uniformly. This allows for compliance with legal standards, facilitates traceability for debugging or forensic analysis, and ensures consistency across the entire microservices ecosystem.
