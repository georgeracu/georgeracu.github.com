## Intro

## Algorithms

### Big O

In simple terms represents the worst case scenario for executing an operation on a data structure, related to the length n of the data structure.

|Operation |Array |List |
|---|---|---
|Insert |O(n) |O(1)
|Delete |O(1) |O(n)
|Random read |O(1) |O(n) 
|Sequential read |O(1) | O(1)

## Binary Search

### Input:a sorted array

### Output: item (if found) or null/nil

## Data Structures

### Array

* A contiguous block of memory 
* Indexing starts from 0

### Linked List

* Non-contiguous blocks of memory
* One element links to the next
* Has the concept of `head` and `tail`
* Head represents the first element
* Tail represents the list without the head
