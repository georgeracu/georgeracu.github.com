## API Design Principles

<hr/>

-   Do one thing and do it well
-   Make it fast
-   Make it easy to get started
-   Intuitive consistency
-   Return meaningful errors
-   Avoid breaking changes

---

## Steps in API Design:

<hr/>

-   Write an API spec
-   Internal API review
-   Early API Partner feedback
-   Beta Testing to selected partners to gather feedback

Use oauth scopes to provide fine grained access to the payloads

---

## Monitoring Debt

<hr/>

- APIs are growing every day, the easier we make it to add APIs to our catalogue, the harder we make it to monitor and observe behaviour and usage patterns for our APIs

- One unified place where to view the following for your APIs:
    - Overall API traffic
    - Overall latency over the API traffic
    - Overall errors over the APIs
- Some APIs might be performing and some other might be underperforming
- How do we know which one does well, OK and needs help?
