## Applying TPS Principles: Understand our Current Situation

<hr/>

### Genchi Genbutsu (現地現物) - Go and See for Yourself

Before we can improve, we must understand where we are:

- **Current State Assessment**: What is the actual situation on the ground?
- **Data-Driven Understanding**: Gather facts, not assumptions
- **Stakeholder Perspectives**: Listen to multiple viewpoints
- **Problem Identification**: What challenges are we really facing?

*"You cannot manage what you cannot measure"* - but first, you must observe.

### Vision of Excellence - Where we want to be

Our target state as Product Owners:

- **Customer-Centric Delivery**: Every decision focused on customer value
- **Lean Mindset**: Eliminate waste, maximise flow, respect people
- **Effective Collaboration**: Seamless partnership with our delivery partners

## Identify the Gap

<hr/>

### Problem Solving - Understanding the challenges

Based on the survey results, we'll identify:

- **Knowledge Gaps**: What Product Owner concepts need strengthening?
- **Process Challenges**: Where do waterfall methodologies create friction?
- **Communication Issues**: What causes misalignment with our partners?
- **Decision-Making Obstacles**: What slows down value delivery?
- **Cultural Barriers**: What mindset shifts are needed?

#### Next Steps:

- Analyse survey data to prioritise learning objectives
- Design targeted sessions addressing specific gaps
- Create actionable improvement plans

## Survey (Current Situation)

<hr/>

- This survey helps us understand our current skills, experience, challenges, and learning needs so that we can tailor the upcoming Product Owner tutorial series to be most valuable for us.
- Your responses will be treated confidentially. Aggregate data may be used to improve the training program, but individual responses will not be shared.
- All answers are collected anonymously
- Time required: 25-30 minutes
- Language: English (you can use machine translation from your preferred language into English)
- Please answer honestly. There are no "wrong" answers - this is about understanding where we are now so I can help you grow. If you don't know something, that's okay and helpful for me to know!

- **Survey link will be shared during the session.**
- **Survey results will be compiled and shared during the next session.**

## What's next?

### Our Learning Journey Continues

Based on today's survey results, we will:

1. **Analyse Current State**: Review responses to understand our starting point
2. **Design Targeted Sessions**: Create focused learning modules addressing identified gaps
3. **Apply Lean Principles**: Use continuous improvement in our own learning process
4. **Practice with Real Scenarios**: Work through challenges you face with our delivery partners

#### Future Topics May Include:

* Effective backlog management across methodologies
* Communication strategies with delivery teams
* Value-driven prioritisation techniques
* Stakeholder alignment and expectation management

**Remember**: This is a learning journey, not a destination. We'll adapt based on what we discover together.
