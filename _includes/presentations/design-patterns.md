# Design Patterns in Java

<hr/>

* Composition over Inheritance

## Implementation Inheritance

<hr/>

### General guidance

* One class extends another class
* To be used on classes that have been designed and documented for extension
* Should not cross package boundaries
* Violates the principle of _encapsulation_
* Should not extend 3rd party library classes
* Use `final` classes when your classes are public and not designed for inheritance
