## Intro

I am a software engineer experienced in delivering software solutions for e-commerce and payment systems. I worked both on front-end and back-end in delivering required functionality using a variety of programming languages and frameworks: Java, Clojure, Kotlin, DropWizard, Vaadin, Java EE, C#, ASP.NET MVC and Web Forms, PostgreSQL, SQLServer, MySQL, Javascript, NodeJS, Express.
